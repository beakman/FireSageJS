/**
 * The `onDisconnect` class allows you to write or clear data when your client
 * disconnects from the Database server. These updates occur whether your
 * client disconnects cleanly or not, so you can rely on them to clean up data
 * even if a connection is dropped or a client crashes.
 *
 * The `onDisconnect` class is most commonly used to manage presence in
 * applications where it is useful to detect how many clients are connected and
 * when other clients disconnect. See
 * {@link https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/offline-capabilities | Enabling Offline Capabilities in JavaScript}
 * for more information.
 *
 * To avoid problems when a connection is dropped before the requests can be
 * transferred to the Database server, these functions should be called before
 * writing any data.
 *
 * Note that `onDisconnect` operations are only triggered once. If you want an
 * operation to occur each time a disconnect occurs, you'll need to re-establish
 * the `onDisconnect` operations each time you reconnect.
