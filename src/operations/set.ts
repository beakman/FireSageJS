/**
 * Writes data to this Database location.
 *
 * This will overwrite any data at this location and all child locations.
 *
 * The effect of the write will be visible immediately, and the corresponding
 * events ("value", "child_added", etc.) will be triggered. Synchronization of
 * the data to the Firebase servers will also be started, and the returned
 * Promise will resolve when complete. If provided, the `onComplete` callback
 * will be called asynchronously after synchronization has finished.
 *
 * Passing `null` for the new value is equivalent to calling `remove()`; namely,
 * all data at this location and all child locations will be deleted.
 *
 * `set()` will remove any priority stored at this location, so if priority is
 * meant to be preserved, you need to use `setWithPriority()` instead.
 *
 * Note that modifying data with `set()` will cancel any pending transactions
 * at that location, so extreme care should be taken if mixing `set()` and
 * `transaction()` to modify the same data.
 *
 * A single `set()` will generate a single "value" event at the location where
 * the `set()` was performed.
 *
 * @param ref - The location to write to.
 * @param value - The value to be written (string, number, boolean, object,
 *   array, or null).
 * @returns Resolves when write to server is complete.
