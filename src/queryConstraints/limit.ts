/**
 * Creates a new `QueryConstraint` that if limited to the first specific number

 *
 * The `limitToFirst()` method is used to set a maximum number of children to be
 * synced for a given callback. If we set a limit of 100, we will initially only
 * receive up to 100 `child_added` events. If we have fewer than 100 messages
 * stored in our Database, a `child_added` event will fire for each message.
 * However, if we have over 100 messages, we will only receive a `child_added`
 * event for the first 100 ordered messages. As items change, we will receive
 * `child_removed` events for each item that drops out of the active list so
 * that the total number stays at 100.
 *
 * You can read more about `limitToFirst()` in
 * {@link https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/lists-of-data#filtering_data | Filtering data}.
