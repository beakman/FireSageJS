info 
1.  set(ref(db, "users////////abc"), something) is equivalent to set(ref(db, "users/abc"), something)
2. Index not defined, add ".indexOn": ".value", for path "/a", to the rules <--orderBy Value

query rules:
1. Query: When ordering by key, you may only pass one argument to startAt(), endAt(), or equalTo().
2. cursor does nothing without orderBy, ban cursor without orderBy
3. orderBy first or cursor first doesnt matter
4. You can't combine multiple orderBy calls.
