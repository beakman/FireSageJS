query rules:
1. Query: When ordering by key, you may only pass one argument to startAt(), endAt(), or equalTo(). // actually include startAfter and endBefore
2. When ordering by key, the argument passed to startAt(), startAfter(), endAt(), endBefore(), or equalTo() must be a string.
3. cursor does nothing without orderBy, ban cursor without orderBy
4. orderBy first or cursor first doesnt matter
5. You can't combine multiple orderBy calls.

key naming rule:
key argument was an invalid key = "1".  Firebase keys must be non-empty strings and can't contain ".", "#", "$", "/", "[", or "]").
